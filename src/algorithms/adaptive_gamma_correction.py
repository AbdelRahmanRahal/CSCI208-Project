	"""
	Applies adaptive gamma correction to an input image.

	This function improves the visibility of details in both dark and bright
	regions of an image by adjusting the gamma value adaptively based on the
	local brightness of different blocks within the image.

	Parameters:
	- image (Union[str, Image.Image]): Either a file path to an image (as a string) or a PIL `Image` object.
	  If a string is provided, the image will be loaded using PIL.
	- block_size (int, optional): The size of the blocks over which gamma correction is applied. Defaults to 16.
	- gamma_range (tuple, optional): The minimum and maximum gamma values to use for correction. Defaults to (0.5, 2.0).

	Returns:
	- Image.Image: A PIL `Image` object representing the corrected version of the input image.

	Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of pixels in the image.

	Space complexity: O(n), where n is the number of pixels in the image.

	Note: The gamma value for each block is calculated based on the average brightness of the block,
	allowing for adaptive enhancement across the image.
