def gamma_correction(image: Union[str, Image.Image], gamma: float = 2.2) -> Image.Image:
	"""
	Applies gamma correction to an image.

	Parameters:
	- image (Union[str, Image.Image]): Either a file path to an image (as a string) or a PIL `Image` object.
	  If a string is provided, the image will be loaded using PIL.
	- gamma: The gamma value to apply. Default is 2.2, which is commonly used for screen displays.

	Returns:
	- Image.Image: A PIL `Image` object representing the gamma-corrected image.

	Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of pixels in the image.

	Space comlexity: O(n), where n is the number of pixels in the image.
