Input: kernel size as kernel_size (integer), and sigma (float).
————————————————————————————————
INITIALIZE a 1D array as kernel_1d with values ranging from -(size // 2) to (size // 2)

FOR each index i in kernel_1d:
	APPLY the Gaussian function to the value at index i
ENDFOR

NORMALIZE kernel_1d by dividing each element by the sum of all elements in kernel_1d

INITIALIZE a 2D array as kernel_2d with dimensions kernel_size x kernel_size

FOR each row i in kernel_2d:
	FOR each column j in kernel_2d:
		SET kernel_2d[i][j] to the product of kernel_1d[i] and kernel_1d[j]
	ENDFOR
ENDFOR

RETURN kernel_2d as a 2D NumPy array
