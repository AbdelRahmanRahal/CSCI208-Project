Input: image array as Image.
Precondition: Image color mode is greyscale.
————————————————————————————————
INITIALIZE a histogram array as hist_array with 256 bins set to 0

FLATTEN Image to a 1D array

FOR each pixel in the flattened Image:
	INCREMENT the count in the histogram bin corresponding to the pixel value
ENDFOR

INITIALIZE a cumulative distribution function (CDF) array as CDF_array with 256 bins set to 0

SET the first element of CDF_array to the first element of hist_array

FOR each subsequent element in hist_array starting from the second element:
	ADD the current histogram element to the previous CDF element and store the result in the current CDF element
ENDFOR

FIND the minimum and maximum values in CDF_array

IF the minimum and maximum values are the same THEN
	SKIP the normalization step
ELSE
	NORMALIZE CDF_array by subtracting the minimum value from each element and then
	dividing each element by the difference between the maximum and minimum values, finally multiplying by 255
ENDIF

USING the normalized CDF as a lookup table, transform the pixel values in the image to enhance contrast:
	FOR each pixel in the flattened Image:
		LOOKUP the corresponding value in the normalized CDF using the pixel value as the index
		REPLACE the pixel value with the looked-up value
	ENDFOR

RESHAPE the transformed pixel values back to the original image shape

RETURN the enhanced image
