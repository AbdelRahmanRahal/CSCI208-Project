Input: image array as Image, block size as block_size (integer), gamma range as gamma_range (tuple of 2 floats)
————————————————————————————————
GET the height and width of Image as H and W

FOR each block Image with size block_size:
	CALCULATE the average brightness of the block
	CALCULATE the gamma value based on the average brightness using the calculate_gamma function
	APPLY gamma correction to the block using the formula: P_c = (P_uc / P_max) ^ γ * P_max
	REPLACE the original block Image with the corrected block
ENDFOR

RETURN the corrected image
