Input: image array as Image.
Precondition: Image is greyscale.

DEFINE Sobel operators for x-direction as sobel_x and y-direction as sobel_y

APPLY sobel_x to the image using the convolve function
STORE the result in edges_x

APPLY sobel_y to the image using the convolve function
STORE the result in edges_y

COMBINE the results of edges_x and edges_y to compute the magnitude of the gradient:
	Edges = sqrt(edges_x^2 + edges_y^2)

NORMALIZE Edges to the range 0-255 by dividing each element by the maximum value and multiplying by 255

RETURN Edges
