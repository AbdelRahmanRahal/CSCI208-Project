Input: image array as Image, kernel size as kernel_size (integer).
————————————————————————————————
IF kernel_size is even THEN
	INCREMENT kernel_size by 1 to ensure it's odd
ENDIF

CREATE a kernel filled with ones as Kernel and normalize it by dividing each element by the total number of elements (kernel_size^2)

CALCULATE the new dimensions of the blurred image based on the kernel size

INITIALIZE an empty array for the blurred image with the calculated dimensions

FOR each color channel (RGB) in the image:
	APPLY Kernel to the color channel using the convolve function
	STORE the result in the corresponding channel of the blurred image array
ENDFOR

RETURN the blurred image
