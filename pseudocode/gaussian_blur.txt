Input: image array as Image, kernel size as kernel_size (integer), and sigma (float).
————————————————————————————————
IF kernel_size is even THEN
	INCREMENT kernel_size by 1 to ensure it's odd
ENDIF

CREATE a Gaussian kernel as Kernel using kernel_size and sigma

CALCULATE the new dimensions of the blurred image based on the kernel size

INITIALIZE an empty array for the blurred image with the calculated dimensions with zeros

FOR each color channel (RGB) Image:
	APPLY Kernel to the color channel using the convolve function
	STORE the result in the corresponding channel of the blurred image array
ENDFOR

RETURN the blurred image
