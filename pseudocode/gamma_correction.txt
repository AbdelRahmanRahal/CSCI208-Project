Input: image array as Image, gamma (float).
Precondition: gamma must be greater than 0, Image color mode is RGB.
————————————————————————————————
IF gamma is equal to 1 THEN
	RETURN the original image since gamma correction does not change the image
ENDIF

APPLY gamma correction to Image using the formula: P_c = (P_uc / P_max) ^ γ * P_max

RETURN the gamma-corrected image
